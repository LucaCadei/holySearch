Simple Information Retrieval system for the Bible (Italian translation).
It is based on a TF-IDF weighting schema, with some preprocessing on the corpus 
(e.g stemming, stop word dropping, ...).
Given a query, the system outputs the k most relevant paragraphs according to the 
TF-IDF vector space model.
